  Provision
  How to advertise service (Pathlet)
    Be able specify services sufficiently advertise them
      (Optional) Performance Metrics: Bandwidth, Jitter, Lost Probability, Delay
      Provisioning Parameter: Power Consumption, Wavelength, (optical packet) Modulation scheme
  Purchase Request

Anything that is free does not need to be provisioned
What is injection point
A Customer with a single endpoint (source) can not have the same destination for multiple flows at the same time
Metrics: OPS/OCS format

Advertising:
Provisioning: Needs to OPCI
Service Generator: Simulator : Pricing Algorithm

OCS Expecting more lightpath requirement in the future for social/sport event, natural disaster
Why would you reduce OCS? You would want to increase OPS based on the usage.
Define utility on both the customer and provider side. Determine strategy for shifting resources between OCS/OPS

Agree on the format of socket_provider
NextNode within OCS trace
OCS Update: Column for Packet Establish/Release(<-)
Move the type (OCS info:, OPS info:, OCS/OPS update:) after the NextNode column
"Routable" network(s) need to be provided from the data plane to assist the service
VPN/IPSec
When OCS route is established it should be bidirectional
  assume their is only a single rate (10 Gbps)
  Inverse Multiplexing?
Shortest path vs. minimum number of lambda (has smallest bottleneck)(<- this will show better result with a larger topology)

Provide a doc on the pfsense to Dr. Miyazawa & Dr. Dutta = Done

NCSU:
  VPN setup
  Call Perl code from our code (Test Harness will due for now)
NICT:
  Make modifications as discussed in today's meeting (Dr. Dutta provided a file with the message changes)

Conclusion:
  -

Takeaway:


Script:
OVS
  ./runOVS
  ./setupOVSIntf mapping.txt
Marketplace
  initialize database if not done
  start marketplace service
Pathlet Provider(s)
  run as background service
  Buy listing service
Pathlet Provider Use Plane
  Install Erlang
    ./configure
    make && make install
  Install LINC
    make offline
  Run LINC-Switch
    /rel/linc/bin/linc console
  Run OpenFlow Switch

- Modify ads given to each provider
- Check what happens when you send a malformed advertisement, currently receive an ACK
